# Git Ignore 

Git ignore is a powerful feature that allows you to specify files and folders that Git should exclude from tracking. This helps to keep your repository clean and manageable by preventing unnecessary files from being committed and version controlled.

## Steps 

### Creating a .gitignore file:

In the root directory of your Git repository, create a new file named ```.gitignore``` (the dot before "gitignore" is important).

This file is itself tracked by Git, but its contents are used to determine which files to ignore.

### Adding Patterns to Ignore Files:

Inside the .gitignore file, you can specify patterns to match files and folders you want to exclude.

Here are some common patterns:

```Bash
filename: Ignores a specific file.
folder/*: Ignores all files within a folder.
*.log: Ignores all files with the .log extension.
README.*: Ignores all files starting with "README" and having any extension.
/pycache/: Ignores all files and folders within directories named "pycache" (often generated by Python).
```
### Some Examples:

Here's an example .gitignore file that ignores common files and folders:
```sh
# Ignore temporary files
*.tmp
*.temp

# Ignore IDE configuration files
.idea/
.vscode/

# Ignore log files
*.log

# Ignore environment variable files
.env
```

### Adding/Removing Files:

To start ignoring an existing file, simply add its name or a matching pattern to the .gitignore file and commit the changes.
To stop ignoring a file, remove the corresponding pattern from the .gitignore file and commit the changes. Git will then start tracking the file again.

### When to Use `.gitignore`:

Commonly ignored files include:
System-generated files (e.g., .DS_Store on macOS)
IDE or editor configuration files
Build artifacts (e.g., compiled code)
Log files
Environment variable files

## Git Desktop

While GitHub Desktop doesn't have a built-in editor for .gitignore files, it offers a user-friendly way to manage ignored files visually. Here's how to handle .gitignore files within GitHub Desktop:

**Accessing the .gitignore File**:

Click on the `Repository` menu in the top bar.

Select `Repository Settings`....

In the pop-up window, navigate to the `Ignored files` tab.

**Viewing Ignored Files**:

This tab displays a list of files and patterns currently configured in your `.gitignore` file. You'll see the filename or pattern and its status (staged, unstaged, or modified).

**Adding Ignored Files**:

Click the `+` button at the bottom of the list.

In the pop-up window, enter the filename or pattern you want to ignore (e.g., "*.log", "README.draft").

Click `Add`. This adds the pattern to the list of ignored files and stages the change to the `.gitignore` file itself.

**Removing Ignored Files**:

Select the file or pattern you want to remove from the list.

Click the `-` button at the bottom of the list.

This removes the pattern from the list and stages the change to the .gitignore file.

**Saving Changes**:

Once you've added or removed ignored files, click the Commit button at the bottom of the Repository Settings window.

This commits the changes you made to the .gitignore file. Remember to push these changes to your remote repository if applicable.

### Additional Notes:

You can also manage ignored files through the command line using the git add, git rm, and git commit commands for the .gitignore file itself.

While GitHub Desktop doesn't directly edit the content within the .gitignore file, it provides a convenient interface for adding, removing, and committing changes to the ignore patterns.
