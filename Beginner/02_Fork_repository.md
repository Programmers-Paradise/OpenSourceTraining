# Fork a Repository on GitHub

## Why to Fork the Repository??

Forking a repository is a common way to create a personal copy of someone else's project so that you can make changes and improvements without affecting the original repository.

## How to Fork

### Step 1: Locate the Fork Button:
- On the top right of the repository page, you'll see a ``Fork`` button.
- It's usually near the top right corner of the page, next to the ``Star`` and ``Watch`` buttons.

### Step 2: Click the Fork Button:
- Click the ``Fork`` button. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### Step 3: Wait for the Forking Process to Complete
- GitHub will start copying the repository to your account.
- This may take a few moments.
- Once itâ€™s done, you'll be redirected to the forked repository under your account.
